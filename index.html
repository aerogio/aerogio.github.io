		    <p> As soon as I started learning about Computer Fluid Dynamics I could not stop my self. I had the possibilty to simulate point by point with fancy colors the dynamics of any flow. Even though it's not all puppy dogs and rainbows and the reality is much more complicated I was instantly blown away.</p>

		    <p> One lazy sunny sunday afternoon I was strolling around with friends when we saw some little birds escaping from a flower shop. This old crazy Swedish lady was selling Rehab Bonsai with an interesting trunk S-shape for 50kr. Rehab Bonsai means that basically the tree was half dead, yours the challenge to revive it. I obviously won the challenge, which unfortunately made me fall into a bonsai black hole </p>

			    <b> GARY: </b> My Rehab bonsai, which by the way went out from rehab pretty soon, is Gary. He is a Chinese Elm Bonsai, super cute and lately has also a son, Gary Junior growing from a cutting. I tried to cut several branches, but only one survived.  <br> <br>
			    <b> KAREN:</b> My second in line is a small female rosemary bonsai, which in fact is not really a bonsai. Yet. From a normal rosemary bush I am trying to grow a bonsai, but she is having a hard time lately. <br> <br>
			    <b> KIM: </b> Kim is a beautiful example of non-binary japanese red maple bonsai, which my mum brought me for my birthday. Honestly I love it, but it should stay outside, and I don't really think it will survive the winter, but we will see.

		    <h2 id="org6ede5e2"> EMACS</h2>
		    <p> When I started my master thesis I was told to use a text editor, I never used one before, except the integrated text editor in Matlab. I started off with Gedit. After 10 minutes I asked my first question to my supervisor, which showed me using his favorite text editor VIM. It was CRAZY. But vim was not for me, so I started learning Emacs. Later on I discovered that emacs is so much more than a text editor   </p>

			    <b> EMACS </b> upsets me everyday and my life has become emacs. I know that it is probably not great, yeah whatever. <br> <br> I am still not an elisp programmer and I am pretty mch limited to steal and copy-paste configuration-code from other users, but I am quite satisfied with the ultimate result. <br> <br> Of course please check Out my <a href="files/giosconfig/configuration.html" id="ActualLink">Emacs Configuration</a>, and reach out if you have any question or advice

		    <p> I have been playing volleyball since I was 6 years old. Without playing for three years during my bachelor in Milan it means that it's 15 years as of 2020. Well That's pretty much I would say. Volleyball is my source number one of frustration, fun, happyness and depression. A lot of mixed feelings maybe.</p>
